# RecursiveGenerics

This Java project demonstrates the use of generic recursion for reversing integers, doubles, and strings. The RecursiveReverser class employs recursion to reverse these data types, showcasing a versatile and reusable approach.

# Features:

Reverse integers using generic recursion.
Reverse doubles using generic recursion.
Reverse strings using generic recursion.

# How to Use:

Run ReverseTest.java.
Enter the desired data type (int, double, or string).
Follow the prompts to provide input.
Experience the recursive reversal in action!
